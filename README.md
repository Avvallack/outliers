# Outliers
basic outlier detection algorithms usage

This models based on the data from: https://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/research/outlier-evaluation/DAMI/literature/ALOI/

Has been implemented two opportunities to detect outliers:
- Supervised approach with knn, logistic regression, svm and boosting algorithms
- Unsupervised approach with isolation forest, dbscan, oneclassssvm and localoutlierfactor algorithms
